Here's the structure that my solution Go Through:

Domain Layer (TaskManagementSystem.Domain):
I Define entities representing core domain concepts ( User, Task).
Define repository interfaces for each entity (e.g., IUserRepository, ITaskRepository).
Implement a generic repository and unit of work patterns.
Application Layer (TaskManagementSystem.Application):
Define DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for communication between my application and the Presentation layer (API).
Define service interfaces (e.g., IUserService, ITaskService) that encapsulate the application logic.
The interfaces defined here are simple and just cover basic process-related to the application
Implement service classes that use the repository interfaces from the domain layer.
Implement AutoMapper to map between entities and DTOs.
Infrastructure Layer (TaskManagementSystem.Infrastructure):
Implement concrete repository classes (e.g., UserRepository, TaskRepository) from the repository interfaces defined in the domain layer.
The first commit of the project focuses on the GenericRepository.
Implement the database context class (ApplicationDbContext) that inherits from DbContext.
after that, I go to the Dependency Injection Container in the API and Register the database context and repository implementations in the dependency injection container.
API Layer (TaskManagementSystem.Api):
Implement API controllers (e.g., UserController, TaskController) that use the service interfaces from the application layer.
Configure dependency injection for services in the API project's Program.cs.
Configure Swagger for API documentation.
